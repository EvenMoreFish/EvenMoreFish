:::info

To contribute to this documentation you need to create a PR with your changes.
The EMF docs are written mostly using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) or MDX (MDX is like Markdown but with support for js components).

:::

## First Steps

1. Fork and clone the EMF repo or use a client ([GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)) or anything else:
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="git" label="git">
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/EvenMoreFish/EvenMoreFish.git
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="gh-cli" label="GitHub CLI">
        ```bash
        gh repo clone EvenMoreFish/EvenMoreFish
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. The documentation folder is located under "docs", make your changes, and submit the PR.

:::tip

If it's a small change, you can submit the change directly from your browser by clicking the "edit" button on that particular file.
